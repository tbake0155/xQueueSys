These built-in programs are simple programs designed to allow the user to launch xqueuesys and have programs ready to be called. 

If any processes are added to the processes folder, they will not be detected.  The code could be modified to dynamically add
any process that is included in the processes file, but it was not designed that.  However, the code can easily be modified to 
add new processes during the star-up of xqueuesys. Look at the source code in priority_queue/src/xqueuesys.cpp.
